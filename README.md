For simplicity, I have upload 1o 10 example gene files for demonstration.
1, The Rds objects in "TCGAdata" directory are the cpg probe flanking on either end of each gene witin 500 kb.
2, "Select_prob.RDs" are the probability for every distance from a gene. This file conrresponds to the one named "crc_select_prob.Rds" from your supplementary file.
3, The Rds objects in "Preliminary" directory are exactly the same with the ones from "TCGAdata" directory only with selection probability infomation for each cpg probe.
