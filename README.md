For simplicity, I have upload 1o 10 example gene files for demonstration. 
1, The Rds objects in "TCGAdata" directory are the cpg probe flanking on either end of each gene within 500 kb. 
2, "Select_prob.RDs" are the probability for every distance from a gene. This file corresponds to the one named "crc_select_prob.Rds" from your supplementary file. 
3, The Rds objects in "Preliminary" directory are the same with the ones from "TCGAdata" directory only with selection probability information for each CpG probe.
